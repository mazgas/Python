''' Breakdown of the Line
movies_90s['duration']:
This part selects the duration column from the movies_90s DataFrame. It contains the duration of each movie in the 1990s.
.mode():
The mode() function in pandas calculates the mode of the selected column. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the column. The result is a Series containing all the mode values (if there are multiple modes).
[0]:
Since mode() returns a Series, [0] is used to select the first element of the Series. This is done to get a single value representing the most frequent movie duration. '''
